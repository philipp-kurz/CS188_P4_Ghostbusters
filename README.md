# CS188_P4_Ghostbusters
Implemented Pacman agents that "bust ghosts"using Hidden Markov Models and Particle Filtering. Project 4 for CS188 - "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" at UC Berkeley during Spring 2020.

# CS188_P3_Reinforcement_Learning
Implemented value iteration and Q-learning algorithms. [Project 3 for CS188](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp20/project3/) - "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" at UC Berkeley during Spring 2020.
The code is based on skeleton code from the class. Project was completed using the PyCharm Python IDE. This submission received full score.

These agents are able to learn optimal policies until convergence when put into an environment that can be characterized as a Markov Decision Process using Transition functions (non-deterministic acting) and Reward functions.
