# CS188_P4_Ghostbusters
Implemented Pacman agents that "bust ghosts"using Hidden Markov Models and Particle Filtering. [Project 4 for CS188](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp20/project4/) - "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" at UC Berkeley during Spring 2020.

---
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that uses non-deterministic sensor input to exactly identify where each ghost has to be.
